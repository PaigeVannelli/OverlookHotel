## Learning Goals

* Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
* Work with an API to send and receive data
* Solidify the code review process
* Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Technologies Used  

* JavaScript
* Sass
* HTML
* Mocha and Chia testing
* fetch API

## Set Up and Instructions

To view the code, please ask to be a collaborator and then go to the GitHub repo (https://github.com/PaigeVannelli/SlapJack).

## Functionality

Customers are able to log in using their user name customer plus any number one through 50 and a password of overlook2021. The login page will prompt the user to fix any errors with username or password.

</p>

Upon loggin in, a customer should see all of their previous bookings as well as any upcoming bookings. Customers will also see a total amount spent on previous bookings.

</p>

A customer can search for a new booking on the sidebar and filter by date as well as room type. Once a customer hits search they should see all the available rooms on that date with an option to book.

Once the customer books a room they will see a bookig confirmation with booking details. The booking will also be displayed in their upcoming bookings. If a customer clicks on their name it will take them back to their homepage view.
